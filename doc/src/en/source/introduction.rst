About Raptor
=============

Raptor is a source code editor supporting several languages. 
It is largely inspired by Notepad++ editor but has the advantage of being portable, running on windows,linux and mac os.

The project is still in the development phase and has quite a few bugs, however, it's usable and already has some nice features...
