**raptor** is a source code editor supporting several languages. It is largely inspired by Notepad++ editor but has the advantage of being portable, running on windows,linux and mac os. (_[more screenshot here](Screenshot.md)_)

The project is still in the development phase, however, it's usable and already has some nice features...

I hope you enjoy Raptor as much as I enjoy coding it.
